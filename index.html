        The BRICS cooperation mechanism was launched in 2006, initially comprising Brazil, Russia, India, and China; South Africa joined in 2011.[5] This is the first BRICS summit to feature Indonesia after being admitted on 8 January 2025. Between 28 and 29 April 2025, the foreign ministers of BRICS member states met in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, ahead of the leaders' summit.[7] Although the ministers failed to release a joint communique, they voiced concern over the rise of protectionist trade practices under the Trump administration in the United States.[8] Chinese leader Xi Jinping did not attend the summit for the first time since succeeding Hu Jintao as CCP General Secretary in 2012. [9] Russian President Vladimir Putin attended the meeting only virtually due to an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for war crimes during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.As of July 2025, the BRICS grouping accounts for over 45% of global GDP (nominal) and over 50% at PPP, represents more than half of the world's population, and controls significant shares of global energy reserves, industrial capacity, and critical mineral resources.
