    <p>
      Dear Sadit and Abdullah,<br> 
      An important chapter of your life is coming
      up—HSC results. Your hard work, patience, and confidence will surely bring
      you the sweet fruits of success. Whatever the result, remember—it is just
      a step, not the end of life. Your inner talent, honesty, and fighting
      spirit are your real strength. I sincerely hope that both of you will
      achieve brilliant results and move forward on the path of greater success
      in the future. May Allah make it easy for you. Best wishes—on the path of
      a bright future.
    </p>
